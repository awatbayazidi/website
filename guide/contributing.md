## Documentation
Documentation is hosted within it's own [repository](https://github.com/caffeinated/website). Pages are written in markdown and rendered through the use of [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). After installing the necessary dependencies through `yarn`, you can start writing and contributing to the documentation locally by running the `yarn docs:dev` command. This will spin up a server instance and start watching and compiling any newly added or modified markdown file.

When you're happy with your work and are ready to send a pull request, close your server and compile the documentation for production by running `yarn docs:build`. This will generate the static files used on the server.
