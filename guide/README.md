# Getting Started
You will find installation instructions for each of our packages within their relevant documentation. A complete list of packages are found within the sidebar to the left as well as in the dropdown in the upper-right hand corner of this website.

## Standards
All of our packages follow the FIG standards PSR-1, PSR-2, and PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code.
